WP Email Template - responsive, customizable, email browser optimized template for all WordPress and plugin generated emails e.g. WP e-Commerce, Gravity Forms. 
  
== Description ==

WP Email Template does just 2 things - beautifully

1. Applies a responsive, customizable, optimized html email template to every email sent from your WordPress site including plugin generated emails.

2. Easy to use visual editor allows you to customize the style and header, footer content of your WP Email Template to match your site. 

= Your Brand =

It does not matter if you are running a start-up 1 person blog or an e-commerce site with 1,000's of products you are trying to build a brand - your brand. WP Email Template ensures that when people interact with you via a comment on a blog post, an email inquiry, a purchase transaction, in fact any email communication between your site and them carries your branding. 

= Why we built it =

We built this plugin because we believe it is important that every contact we have with our clients carries our brand. We just hated those boring unbranded plain text emails WordPress generates and the unbranded html styling some plugins apply to our contact with our customers. So we built the WP Email Template to make sure that every contact our online customers have with us carries our brand. 
We have used it for a while now and just love it. Our inspiration for the WP Email Template came from the inspired work by the [Mike](http://profiles.wordpress.org/mikejolley/), [James](http://profiles.wordpress.org/jameskoster/) and [Coen](http://profiles.wordpress.org/CoenJacobs/) at [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/)

= Plugins =

WP Email Template works with every plugin we have tested it on.

* Gravity Forms - see the screen shots - looks sensational with the default Gravity style.
* Contact Form 7 - see the screenshots
* WP e-Commerce - applies the template to every store generated email to customers and admins
* WooCommerce - by default the plugin ignores WooCommerce email output - but you can choose to apply your Wordpress Email Template to Woocomerce emails.
* WP Mail SMPT - WP Email Template does not interfere with the way any WordPress or any plugin handles email output - it just applies the template to any output content.
* BackupBuddy - I love it when even my admin emails are branded - see the screenshots 

Please let us know if you find a plugin that WP Email Template does not apply your template to that plugins email output.
