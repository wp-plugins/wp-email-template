WP Email Template - responsive, customizable, email browser optimized template for all WordPress and plugin generated emails e.g. WP e-Commerce, Gravity Forms. 
  
== Description ==

WP Email Template does just 2 things - beautifully

1. Applies a responsive, customizable, optimized html email template to every email sent from your WordPress site including plugin generated emails.

2. Easy to use visual editor allows you to customize the style and header, footer content of your WP Email Template to match your site.

= Your Brand =

It does not matter if you are running a start-up 1 person blog or an e-commerce site with 1,000's of products you are trying to build a brand - your brand. WP Email Template ensures that when people interact with you via a comment on a blog post, an email inquiry, a purchase transaction, in fact any email communication between your site and them carries your branding. 

= Why we built it =

We built this plugin because we believe it is important that every contact we have with our clients carries our brand. We just hated those boring unbranded plain text emails WordPress generates and the unbranded html styling some plugins apply to our contact with our customers. So we built the WP Email Template to make sure that every contact our online customers have with us carries our brand. 
We have used it for a while now and just love it. Our inspiration for the WP Email Template came from the inspired work by the [Mike](http://profiles.wordpress.org/mikejolley/), [James](http://profiles.wordpress.org/jameskoster/) and [Coen](http://profiles.wordpress.org/CoenJacobs/) at [WooCommerce](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/woocommerce/)

= Plugins =

WP Email Template works with every plugin we have tested it on.

* Gravity Forms - see the screen shots - looks sensational with the default Gravity style.
* Contact Form 7 - see the screenshots
* WP e-Commerce - applies the template to every store generated email to customers and admins
* WooCommerce - Version 2.0 and backward compatible. By default the plugin ignores WooCommerce email output - but you can choose to apply your WordPress Email Template to all Woocomerce emails to give you consistant branding across your entire site.
* WP Mail SMPT - WP Email Template does not interfere with the way any WordPress or any plugin handles email output - it just applies the template to any output content.
* BackupBuddy - I love it when even my admin emails are branded - see the screenshots
* Wordfence - Branded security emails - nice. 

Please let us know if you find a plugin that WP Email Template does not apply your template to that plugins email output.

	* Ran full WP_DEBUG All Uncaught exceptions errors and warnings fixed.
* Fixed :
	* Plugins admin script and style not loading in Firefox with SSL on admin. Stripped http// and https// protocols so browser will use the protocol that the page was loaded with.

= 1.0.7 - 2013/06/13 =
* Tweak: Added PHP Public Static to functions in Class. Done so that Public Static warnings don't show in DE_BUG mode.

= 1.0.6 - 2013/06/11 =
* Fixed: Email template header image not showing in outbound email template and preview. Header image was uploading and showing correctly in the admin panel under upload input but not showing in template applied to outbound emails and preview.
* Tweak: Updated support URL to the plugins wordpress.org support forum

= 1.0.5 - 2013/04/16 =
* Feature: Added when install and activate plugin link redirects to WP Email Template admin panel instead of the wp-plugins dashboard
* Fix: Yahoo Mail does not support p tag - space between paragraphs. Coded in line CSS fix to auto add space between paragraphs for Yahoo Mail.  
* Fix: Yahoo Mail auto removes body tag and hence would not show the background colour. Coded in-line CSS fix to force Yahoo Mail to show background colour. 
* Fix: Updated all JavaScript functions so that the plugin is compatible with jQuery Version1.9 and backwards to version 1.6. WordPress still uses jQuery version 1.8.3. In themes that use Google js Library instead of the WordPress jQuery then there was trouble because Google uses the latest jQuery version 1.9. There are a number of functions in jQuery Version 1.9 that have been depreciated and hence this was causing errors with the jQuery function in the plugin.

= 1.0.4 - 2013/04/01 =
* Feature: Upgraded plugins admin to use Chosen script for dropdowns and options.
* Feature: Replaced add template header image via URL with image uploader.
* Feature: Added option to set Text link colour in email body. Previously this was auto set to be the same as the header background colour - but caused problems with links not visible when header background and email body background both use the same colour. <strong>( PRO version only)</strong>
* Fixed: Max wide layout issues with template display in iPhone 5.
* Fixed: Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing the email template preview to show a -1 instead of the Template because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php?action=preview_wp_email_template is http: and it is denied hence was returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Email Template Preview action now automatically detects that and works as it should.
* Tweak: Update the plugins wiki docs to show new admin style, image upload feature and colour link text colour options.

= 1.0.3 - 2013/03/05 =
* Feature: Updated all plugin code to be 100% compatible with new WooCommerce V2.0 with backwards compatibility..

* Fixed: When user server does not support  file_get_contents function changes made to the template were not applying to the WooCommerce Email template. We had added a get file from get_stylesheet_directory_uri constant as a work around but had missed the () at the end of the function so it wasn't working
